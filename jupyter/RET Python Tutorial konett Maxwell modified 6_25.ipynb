    "2. Set doesn't have repeated elements, say a set is x = {1,2,3}, adding another 1 into x won't change it at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it seems inconvinient to use set, since its elements are unordered, the advantage is that checking if an element exist in it (inquiry) is super fast, it can be useful to use set when your code performs a lot of inquiries. If a set contains n elements, compared to a list of the same n elements, it'll be n times faster to ask if something is in set compared to asking the same question with a list, and in real life computation, n can be huge. This property is achieved by hashing."
